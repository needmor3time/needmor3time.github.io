The list is in chronological order starting with the latest at the top, so bear in mind that the least simpliest apps are at the bottom :-)  Note that none of these apps have been paid for by any government body or company.</p>

                        <p>The Swift Event application was our first group project.  The assignment called for us to use at least two api's and a new technology.  Our api's were googlemaps and eventful.  We decided to go with an application that you can do a search based on location of things that are 'going on'.  They range from gun shows to quilting, movies, and concerts.  The results of the search are displayed 3 at a time with a maximum of three pages.</p>

                    <p>This homework assignment proved to be rather challeging for me and it's been reworked somewhat from what was originally turned in.  The requirements were to make a trivia application that had a time out feature and would keep track of your correct and incorrect answers.  One of our TA's said "make it hard", and so it is.  Most people only get about 2 or 3 correct answers out of 12 (and I think most of those are lucky guesses :-) ).</p>

                        <p>This assignment was one of our earlier assignments and I probably spent the most time on it.  I had to just about re-write it based on how I thought the code "should work".  It's a simple hang man game with a Greek Gods theme, it gives the answer at the end regardless of winning or losing.</p>
